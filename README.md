# My Profile Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and interests. It highlights my experience as a backend web developer, baker and cake artist, and copywriter. The website also includes a section about me, my skills and competencies, and links to my social media accounts.

## Framework
I used **Bootstrap 5** for this project. I chose Bootstrap because it provides a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, and utility classes that allow for fast development while maintaining a clean and professional design. And also it's easier for me to use and understand.

## What I Learned
- How to structure a modern responsive portfolio layout using Bootstrap.
- How to work with Bootstrap components like navbar, cards, tables, and responsive grids.
- How to customize Bootstrap styles using CSS, including hover effects and transitions.
- Optimizing images and layouts for both desktop and mobile devices using navbar-toggler.

## Challenges Faced
- Overriding Bootstrapâ€™s default table styles to apply custom hover effects.
- Making the layout responsive while keeping images and text (such as backend end developer and copywriter) and grid images to be properly positioned and aligned on smaller screens due to different text lengths(causing the texts to wrap to the next line differently).
- Ensuring proper placement of scripts and styles to make interactive elements like buttons work.
